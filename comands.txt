If you want to Authenticate using git ssh key
    - ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" ( to generate public ssh key for you own) (save it)

    Need to ssh key to the ssh agent in your local sys

    - eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    - ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    - cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa (to view public ssh key)
    Go to Github id
    - find ssh & gpg keys add your public key there
    
    To check
    - ssh -T git@github.com (it show your auth status)

To see user name & email
    - git config --global --list
    - git config --global user.name
    - git config --global user.email
    // to set
    - git config --global user.name "username"
    - git config --global user.email "useremail"

To ensure local repo
    - git clone your_repo_link

STAGING & UNSTAGING

    local-------->staging area------------>repository----------->remote repo
         git add               git commit             git push

    Unstage            - just created/edited a file.
    Ready For staging  - git add .\filename.txt 
    Staged and info    - git commit -m "message content"
    pushing to remote  - git push
    Pulling from repote- git pull

Abbrevations:
    U - Unstage 
    M - Modified

COMMIT :
    For professional commit : 
    https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

    git commit --amend - to edit the commit message

STATUS 
    git status - to check the status of all files
DIFF
    git diff - to see the diff between edited files

BRANCHING :
    If two or more peoples accessing same code may be chances to conflict
    to prevent that BRANCHING concept is came.

    branch Main - main branch is fully running code (both backend frotend)
           frontend - frontend dev created a branch for him to work his feat.
           backend  - backend dev created a branch for him to work his feat.
    
    git branch                    - to view all branch
    git branch branch_name        - to create new branch and stayed in old branch
    git checkout -b "branch_name" - to create new branch and switched to new branch
    git checkout                  - to saw status for currect branch
    git checkout branch_name      - to go another branch
    git push origin branch_name   - to push particular branch (origin - remote repo link)
    git pull oriigin branch_name  - to pull form particulat branch

MERGE CONFLICT :
    SCENARIO :
    1. frontend dev - pulled the index.html and made changes
    2. backend dev  - pulled the index.html and made changes and push that code
    3. frontend dev - (add-committed) try to push the code but not pushing bcoz backend dev update the remote code
    4. frontend dev - pulled the index.html updated code from remote
    5. frontend dev - Merge conflict
    6. frontend dev - discused with the backend dev (accept my change,backend dev change,both changes)
    7. frontend dev - again push not pushed and updated.
